# Valgrind report tool

[Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) is a great tool but the data it reports is not always easy to process.

The Valgrind report tool parses XML output files from valgrind and sums them up to show where the errors are located in the source code.

The results are compiled in HTML files so that the valgrind output can be parsed with a browser.
